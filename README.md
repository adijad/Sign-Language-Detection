# ✋📱 App for Deaf and Mute  

## 📌 Overview  
### 🔎 Motivation  
Communication is an essential part of human interaction. However, **hearing and speech-impaired individuals** face significant barriers in daily communication. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** that translates sign language into readable text.  

The application is designed to:  
✅ **Recognize hand gestures** using **computer vision and machine learning**.  
✅ **Translate gestures into readable text**, enabling **seamless communication**.  
✅ **Provide real-time processing** using **OpenCV, TensorFlow, and Keras**.  

By leveraging **deep learning** and **image processing techniques**, this system ensures **accurate recognition of sign language** gestures, making communication easier for the deaf and mute community.
