# Sign Language Recognition System  

## Overview  
### Motivation  
Communication is an essential part of human interaction. However, **deaf and mute individuals** face challenges in expressing themselves to people unfamiliar with sign language.  

This project introduces a **real-time hand gesture recognition system** that translates sign language into readable text or speech. The system **detects hand gestures using computer vision and deep learning techniques**, ensuring an accessible communication method for people with hearing or speech impairments.  

### Key Features  
**Hand Gesture Recognition** → Detects hand movements and classifies gestures.  
**Real-Time Processing** → Uses **OpenCV, TensorFlow, and CNNs** for instant predictions.  
**Text & Speech Output** → Converts recognized gestures into readable text or synthesized speech.  
**User-Friendly Interface** → Simple UI for accessibility and ease of use.  
**Scalability** → Future integration with **IoT devices, mobile applications, and cloud-based processing**.

## System Architecture  

The system consists of **three main stages**:  

1️. **Training Phase** → Prepares the deep learning model using hand gesture images.  
2. **Testing Phase** → Evaluates the model on unseen gestures to measure accuracy.  
3. **Real-Time Gesture Recognition** → Uses a camera to detect and classify gestures in real time.

## **1. Training Phase**  
During training, the system **learns to recognize different hand gestures** by processing large datasets.  

- **Loading the Gesture** → The dataset is loaded, containing labeled sign language gestures.  
- **Preprocessing** →  
  - Images are resized and normalized for consistency.  
  - Noise reduction techniques improve feature extraction.  
- **Feature Extraction** →  
  - **CNNs extract key patterns from gesture images**.  
  - Feature vectors are generated and passed to the machine learning model.  
- **Training the Model** → The model learns gesture representations by optimizing **cross-entropy loss** and using **data augmentation** to improve generalization.

## **2. Testing Phase**  
Once trained, the model is **evaluated on new unseen gestures** to measure accuracy.  

- **Loading the Gesture** → A new image is input into the system.  
- **Preprocessing** → The same processing steps (resizing, filtering) are applied.  
- **Feature Extraction** → Extracted features are passed to the trained model.  
- **Prediction** → The model classifies the gesture and returns the corresponding label.

## **3. Real-Time Gesture Recognition**  
Once the model is trained and validated, it is used for **real-time recognition** using a webcam.  

1. **Image Acquisition from Camera** → Captures live hand gestures.  
2. **Hand Detection & Tracking** →  
   - OpenCV & Mediapipe track hand movement.  
   - The system isolates the hand region to improve recognition accuracy.  
3. **Capture the Gesture** → Extracts the hand region and converts it into a frame.  
4. **Recognize the Gesture** → The CNN model processes the frame and predicts the gesture.  
5. **Display as Text or Voice** →  
   - The gesture is **translated into text** on the screen.  
   - Future versions will support **speech synthesis** for audio output.
